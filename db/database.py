db/database.py
--------------
SQLAlchemy engines + session factories.

TWO engines, deliberately, not one:

  _admin_engine — connects using DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD, an externally
  provisioned Postgres instance (not Docker-managed — see
  scripts/init_schema.py). Used ONLY inside init_db(), ONLY for one-time
  schema bootstrap: creating tables, the restricted app role, and the
  Row-Level Security policies. Never used to serve a real request.

  engine — connects using APP_DB_USER/APP_DB_PASSWORD (a restricted,
  non-superuser role created by init_db()). This is what every real
  request in this app actually queries through.

Why the split exists: Postgres Row-Level Security CANNOT restrict a
superuser's queries — that's a fixed Postgres rule, no policy setting
changes it. If the app queried using the superuser for everything, the
RLS policies created below would provide zero real protection for the
app's own traffic. This split is what makes RLS meaningful at all.

    in get_db_session_fastapi/get_db_session_context below).

    FORCE (not just ENABLE) is required — without it, RLS is silently
    skipped for the table's OWNER, and in a simple setup like this the
    app role often ends up owning the tables it creates. FORCE closes
    that gap. It does NOT and cannot restrict an actual Postgres
    superuser — nothing can, by Postgres design — which is the whole
    reason the app connects as the restricted role above, not as
    DB_USER.

    — RLS's job here is to be the backstop for ad-hoc READS (a teammate
    in pgAdmin, a future report, a bug in some other service), not to
    re-validate writes that are already independently guaranteed correct.
    Making writes fail-closed too would mean any request whose session
    variables aren't set for any reason (a bug, a forgotten header on a
    brand-new endpoint) fails LOUD on the write path, which is arguably
    safer — but it also means this table becomes unwritable the moment
    that wiring has any bug at all, anywhere. Read-side enforcement gets
    most of the real-world protection (this is what stops the "someone
    ran an unscoped SELECT in pgAdmin" scenario) at a much smaller blast
    radius. Revisit this trade-off if write-path correctness is ever in

    Startup cleanup for local upload files left behind by a dead process.

    2026-08-23, added alongside mark_interrupted_jobs() below and for the
    same reason: ingestion is in-process (BackgroundTasks, no job queue), so
    a crash/OOM/deploy-restart kills the job mid-flight. mark_interrupted_
    jobs() repairs the Postgres row; this repairs the disk. Normally
    pipeline/ingest.py deletes the local copy in its own finally block the
    moment a job ends, so in steady state this finds nothing.

    SAFETY RULE — a file is deleted ONLY when a document row proves S3
    already holds it: source_path still records where the local scratch
    file was written, while stored_path is rewritten to the s3:// URI once
    the object is durably stored. Both must line up.

    The first version of this deleted purely on age and destroyed five real
    files on its first run: documents ingested before S3 existed still have
    a LOCAL stored_path, so their upload was the only copy in the world and
    nothing had ever put it in a bucket. Age alone can never tell "abandoned
    scratch file" apart from "the user's only copy" — the S3 URI is the only
    honest proof, so that is what is checked now. Anything unmatched is left
    on disk: a stray file costs a few MB, and deleting the wrong one is
    unrecoverable.

    The age cutoff (settings.STORAGE_LOCAL_TTL_HOURS, default 4) is a second
    guard on top of that, not the primary one. It is NOT a cache expiry: it
    must stay well above the slowest real ingest, since measured wall time
    for a 40-page PDF is 8-11.5 minutes and a 200-page document can exceed
    40. Anything near 30 minutes could catch a job still parsing.
