pipeline/chunker.py
--------------------
Replaces pipeline/splitter.py's role in the main pipeline (splitter.py's
SemanticChunker required OpenAI embedding calls just to find chunk
boundaries; unstructured's chunk_by_title groups elements by document
structure — headings, list items, page breaks — instead, no extra
embedding cost).

clean_extracted_text() and is_meaningful_chunk() are reused verbatim from
splitter.py (unchanged logic, still correct for post-chunking noise
filtering regardless of which chunker produced the raw text).

    unstructured.chunking.title.chunk_by_title groups elements under their
    nearest heading, splitting further only when a group exceeds
    max_characters — this is what keeps chunks from cutting mid-sentence
    under normal conditions and what keeps a section's content together
    with its heading. multipage_sections=True (the library default, made
    explicit here) keeps a section together even when it spans a page
    break, rather than force-splitting at every page boundary.
    combine_text_under_n_chars merges runs of small elements (list items,
    short paragraphs) instead of emitting a chunk per element.

    Table handling (verified empirically against real documents, not just
    the docs — behavior differs by case): a Table element's
    metadata.text_as_html survives chunking whether the table ends up
    merged into a larger chunk with surrounding text, or isolated on its
    own — either way it's carried into Chunk.table_html below, and such a
    chunk is exempted from is_meaningful_chunk()'s prose-oriented noise
    filter (a short, number-heavy table is legitimate content, not noise).
