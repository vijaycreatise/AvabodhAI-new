    2026-08-23 — why the split. Both used to be settings.MAP_MODEL, the
    model picked for cheap per-chunk ingestion summaries. That meant a
    chart crop re-attached to an answer was read by gpt-4o-mini, while a
    user attaching their OWN image went down api/routes/chat.py's
    multimodal path and got gpt-4o. Same pixels, weaker reader, purely
    because of which door the image came through. Answers now use
    settings.CHAT_MODEL (gpt-4o); helper calls stay on MAP_MODEL, so a
    six-word thread title doesn't cost gpt-4o rates. Ingestion is
    untouched — MAP_MODEL still drives summarisation exactly as before.

    hardcoded 0.3 it was: this call does exact-figure extraction against a
