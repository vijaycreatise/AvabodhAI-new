    Content-unaltered, format-only change — every cell value is carried
    over exactly as extracted, nothing is summarized or reworded (unlike
    the GPT-4o Vision table-crop caption path, which necessarily
    compresses a table into prose). Markdown tables are also more
    token-efficient than raw HTML (no tag overhead) and are what LLMs are
    most commonly trained/evaluated on for tabular reasoning.

    2026-08-22: uses pandas.read_html() rather than a hand-rolled
    BeautifulSoup row/cell walk or markdownify (already a project
    dependency via pipeline/scraper.py) — tested both against a table
    with a rowspan/colspan header (a real pattern in our tables) and both
    produced a MISALIGNED markdown table: the second header row gets
    treated as an ordinary data row, so column counts stop matching
    row-to-row. pandas.read_html() correctly resolves that into a proper
    MultiIndex instead (see _flatten_table_columns above) — this is the
    actual gap that made pandas worth the extra dependency (tabulate,
    for DataFrame.to_markdown()) over what was already in the stack.

    A chunk can carry MULTIPLE concatenated <table> blocks (chunker.py
    doesn't split them) — read_html() already returns one DataFrame per
    <table> found; each is converted and joined with a blank line.

2. RESPONSE SCHEMA — mandatory, no exceptions: the answer stated concisely in your own words, then the [Source: ...] tag at the end, nothing else.
3. PARTIAL DATA: State exactly what IS known, then stop — do not follow it with "I don't have enough information," that's a contradiction, and never open with what the documents do NOT say. Lead with the fact you have. Partial facts are still an answer.
4. CALCULATION: If the documents don't state something directly, find data to calculate it from — including POSSIBLY HELPFUL TABLES, which you may extract from, compute on, and reason over. Exact figures to 2 decimal places, never rounded off or approximate. If calculation isn't possible either, reason it out.
5. CITATION: Cite only the [Source: doc_name, page N] or [Source: doc_name, Section: heading] tag exactly as it appears in the context below — never invent a citation format.
6. IMAGE CAPTIONS: Some context is images (charts, tables, diagrams) captioned by GPT-4o Vision. Treat it with the same confidence as document text and cite it the same way.
7.

                        2. VERBATIM transcription of every visible text, marking, stamp, engraving, label, code, or number — exact characters, not paraphrased or summarized, since an exact value may be the actual answer needed
                        3. Where each marking sits on the object, when position could matter (e.g. "stamped on the underside", "engraved along the left edge")
                        4. Notable condition, features, or anomalies visible
                        5. Any legible data — measurements, dates, serial numbers, quantities

                        Do not vaguely summarize ("text is visible on the object") — transcribe exactly what is legible. If something is illegible or partially obscured, say so explicitly, and add a single-line best-guess of what that part could plausibly have been (context, shape, partial characters) — one line maximum, clearly marked as a guess, not stated as fact.
