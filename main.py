    Load unstructured's table-structure model, without the wasted work its
    own loader does.

    THE PROBLEM. unstructured_inference calls
    TableTransformerForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(model) with no
    arguments. That checkpoint's config carries use_timm_backbone=True and
    use_pretrained_backbone=True, so during __init__ transformers asks timm
    to build a ResNet-18 and fill it with ImageNet weights
    (transformers/models/table_transformer/modeling_table_transformer.py
    line 225) — BEFORE the actual table checkpoint is applied over the top
    of it. Every one of those ImageNet weights is then overwritten.

    Worse, transformers builds the model under its init-empty-weights
    context, so those parameters are meta tensors at that moment. timm's
    load_state_dict copies real weights into placeholders, which does
    nothing, and torch says so — 60 times:

        UserWarning: for conv1.weight: copying from a non-meta parameter in
        the checkpoint to a meta parameter in the current model, which is a
        no-op.

    So the warning is accurate: that copy genuinely does nothing. It is
    reporting wasted work, not a broken model.

    THE FIX. use_pretrained_backbone=False skips the ImageNet fetch
    entirely; the backbone is built empty and the table checkpoint fills it
    as it always did. Verified: warnings 60 -> 0, and all 367 state-dict
    tensors are bit-identical to the default load, so this changes nothing
    about what the model computes.

    Applied here rather than by editing site-packages because
    unstructured_inference's own load_agent() short-circuits when
    tables_agent.model is already set — so pre-loading it correctly means
    every later caller transparently gets this instance. The attributes
    below mirror exactly what its initialize() sets.

    #      full reload, sometimes mid-request — confirmed live as
    #      multi-minute stalls and a "only responds after I stop the
    #      server" symptom. reload_excludes (below) fixes this part.
    #   2. Independently, Windows' multiprocessing.spawn (what WatchFiles
    #      uses to launch the reloaded worker) can deadlock against an
    #      import lock still held in the parent process when a reload
    #      fires while a heavy import graph (openai/qdrant_client/
