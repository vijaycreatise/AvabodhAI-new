"""
api/middleware/tenant_guard_middleware.py
------------------------------------------
Defense-in-depth backstop for multi-tenancy AND department isolation.

Real scoping happens per-route, via api.dependencies.get_tenant_id /
get_org_unit_id as FastAPI dependencies — that's what actually threads
both into the DB queries. This middleware does NOT replace that. What it
does is close a specific future failure mode: someone adds a new
endpoint later, forgets to declare
`tenant_id: str = Depends(get_tenant_id)` (or the org_unit_id
equivalent) on it, and that route silently serves unscoped data with no
error and no warning.

This middleware runs before routing and rejects any request to a
non-exempt path that doesn't carry BOTH X-Tenant-ID and X-Org-Unit-ID —
so a route missing either per-route dependency fails loudly with a 400
instead of quietly leaking. It intentionally does NOT validate the
values beyond presence (that's still get_tenant_id/get_org_unit_id's
job, so error messages and any future validation logic stay in one
place).
